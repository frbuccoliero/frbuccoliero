## 🚀 Hi there, I'm Francesco 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Artificial Intelligence** enthusiast, passionate about developing robust, data-driven, and scalable systems.

I completed my **MSc in Computer Science and Engineering** with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Politecnico di Milano** in October 2025.

I have a previous **BSc Degree** from the same university, obtained in 2023, and an internship work experience at **Amazon Web Services** (AWS) during Summer 2022.
